# MSGISci-Webmap-New
Welcome to LiDAR Veggies! Below is a link to our webmap that encompasses the extent of River Ridge Ranch in the Southern Seqouia's. Our research is centered around the development of 3D models of individual trees using LiDAR, high resolution UAV imagery land cover analysis, and web map development.

This URL will direct you to our webmap that will house LIDAR and UAV data. Enjoy! https://seanreseigh1.github.io/MSGISci-Webmap-New/

All the geojsons are housed within here: https://github.com/Seanreseigh1/MSGISci-Webmap-New/tree/master/Geojsons
